## Whatâ€™s your current situation?

Iâ€™m currrently **employed** and not actively looking.

I will always be open to new challenges and for the right position.

## Whatâ€™s my ideal role?

I thrive when I have freedom to explore problems and possible solutions, I need a flexible and robust work environment with a clear and transparent communication and an healthy ammount of collaboration where me and my team continue to learn and grow.

Prefer to work with **Typescript, React, Gatsby and Next.js**.

Creating web applications with challenging interfaces, interactions and logic where the goal is to output the best user experience possible with a deep understanding of the user and use case.

I enjoy writing documentation, this proccess allows me to understand the existing solutions deeply, question them and perfect them while being valuable to the organization as a whole.

Work life balance is a big deal for me, Iâ€™d like to focus on outcomes and not work hours.

I need to have **empathy** with the target user.

Not open to gambling related roles.

## What sort of company do you want to work with?

I want a company that understands my ideal role, needs to be transparent on what the work is and clear on how Iâ€™ll be doing it with my team.

I need to have a clear understanding of the following:

- How do you expect me to integrate the team?
- What will mainly be my day-to-day work?
- What technologies will I be using?

## Whatâ€™s your preferred stack?

If youâ€™ve read the previous answers you already know that I prefer to work with **Typescript**.

Right now my favorite framework is **React**, thatâ€™s where I feel most productive.

For complex, production apps, I have had my best developer experience with **Next.js**.

I have used all kinds of css solutions, and I feel confortable with most approaches. Most of my main projects used **styled-components,** sass, css modules and styled-jsx.

When writing tests I am productive with **jest** and the testing-library.

For back-end, even though right now Iâ€™m not looking for a fullstack position, I develop with **Node**, as for frameworks: express or nestjs.
