## What sort of company do you want to work with?

I want a company that understands my ideal role, needs to be transparent on what the work is and clear on how Iâ€™ll be doing it with my team.

I need to have a clear understanding of the following:

Right now my favorite frontend framework is **React**, thatâ€™s where I feel most productive.

For complex, production apps, I have had my best developer experience with **Next.js** and **Express.js** APIs.
